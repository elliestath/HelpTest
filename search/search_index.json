The algorithm implements a novel interest point detector stemming from the intuition that image patches which are highly dissimilar over a relatively large extent of their surroundings hold the property of being repeatable and distinctive. This concept of \"contextual self-dissimilarity\" reverses the key paradigm of recent successful techniques such as the Local Self-Similarity descriptor and the Non-Local Means filter, which build upon the presence of similar - rather than dissimilar - patches. Moreover, it extends to contextual information the local self-dissimilarity notion embedded in established detectors of corner-like interest points, thereby achieving enhanced repeatability, distinctiveness and localization accuracy.

Keypoints are detected as extrema in the difference between the Gaussian images. [Source: self adjusted] [SIFT]: Lowe, D.G., 2004.

BFMatcher.match() or BFMatcher.knnMatch() ?? NormType (NORM_L1 / NORM_L2 / NORM_HAMMING / NORM_HAMMING2) -- Distance measurement to be used Ratio: 0.8 -- ratio test proposed by D.Lowe in SIFT paper Cross Matching -- Cross check (bool). If it is true, matching returns only those matches with value (i,j) such that i-th descriptor in set A has j-th descriptor in set B as the best match and vice-versa. That is, the two features in both sets should match each other. It provides consistent result, and is a good alternative to ratio test proposed.

Can be estimated either by using all points ( All points ) to compute an initial homography estimate with a simple least-squares scheme, or RANSAC-based robust method RANSAC , a Least-Median robust method ( LMedS ) or the PROSAC-based robust method RHO . The methods RANSAC , LMeDS and RHO try many different random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each), estimate the homography matrix using this subset and a simple least-square algorithm, and then compute the quality/goodness of the computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC or the median re-projection error for LMeDs). The functions find and return the perspective transformation between the source and the destination plane so that the back-projection error is minimized. Regardless of the method, robust or not, the computed homography matrix is refined further (using inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the re-projection error even more. The method RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but it needs a threshold to distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers. Finally, if there are no outliers and the noise is rather small, use the default method ( All points ).The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is determined up to a scale Fundamental: Calculates the fundamental matrix (projective transformation with at least 7 point correspondences) from the corresponding points in two images, using either the 7-point algorithm , the 8-point algorithm , RANSAC or LMedS . Normally just one matrix is found. But in case of the 7-point algorithm , the function may return up to 3 solutions. FLANN FLANN stands for Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors [Muja 2009]. It contains a collection of algorithms optimized for fast nearest neighbor search in large datasets and for high dimensional features. For large datasets, it can be more efficient than Brute Force.

The algorithm implements a novel interest point detector stemming from the intuition that image patches which are highly dissimilar over a relatively large extent of their surroundings hold the property of being repeatable and distinctive. This concept of \"contextual self-dissimilarity\" reverses the key paradigm of recent successful techniques such as the Local Self-Similarity descriptor and the Non-Local Means filter, which build upon the presence of similar - rather than dissimilar - patches. Moreover, it extends to contextual information the local self-dissimilarity notion embedded in established detectors of corner-like interest points, thereby achieving enhanced repeatability, distinctiveness and localization accuracy.

Can be estimated either by using all points ( All points ) to compute an initial homography estimate with a simple least-squares scheme, or RANSAC-based robust method RANSAC , a Least-Median robust method ( LMedS ) or the PROSAC-based robust method RHO . The methods RANSAC , LMeDS and RHO try many different random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each), estimate the homography matrix using this subset and a simple least-square algorithm, and then compute the quality/goodness of the computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC or the median re-projection error for LMeDs). The functions find and return the perspective transformation between the source and the destination plane so that the back-projection error is minimized. Regardless of the method, robust or not, the computed homography matrix is refined further (using inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the re-projection error even more. The method RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but it needs a threshold to distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers. Finally, if there are no outliers and the noise is rather small, use the default method ( All points ).The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is determined up to a scale Fundamental: Calculates the fundamental matrix (projective transformation with at least 7 point correspondences) from the corresponding points in two images, using either the 7-point algorithm , the 8-point algorithm , RANSAC or LMedS .

The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers. Finally, if there are no outliers and the noise is rather small, use the default method ( All points ).The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is determined up to a scale Fundamental: Calculates the fundamental matrix (projective transformation with at least 7 point correspondences) from the corresponding points in two images, using either the 7-point algorithm , the 8-point algorithm , RANSAC or LMedS . Normally just one matrix is found. But in case of the 7-point algorithm , the function may return up to 3 solutions.","title":"Brute Force"},{"location":"index_old3/#flann","text":"FLANN stands for Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors [Muja 2009].

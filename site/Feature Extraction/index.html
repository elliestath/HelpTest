<p><em>Features from Accelerated Segment Test</em></p>
<p>Modification of the SUSAN corner detector that outperforms previously used detectors in terms of speed and reliability. Is based on Accelerated Segment Test (AST), which is used to distinguish keypoints by examining the intensity values of 16 pixels in a circular pattern around the candidate keypoint pixel. A candidate pixel is considered as keypoint based on a segment test, i.e. if there are at least N continuous pixels that have either higher or lower intensity values than it. Because of his effectiveness, it is suitable for real-time applications.</p>

<p><em>Good Features to Track.</em> </p>
<p>Modified version of the traditional Harris detector as to select only the features that have large eignevalues and pass the dissimilarity  test. Thus, it filters out the less robust ones through a temporal monitoring. In more detail, in order to keep the more robust features, it then rejects corners with minimum eigenvalues less than a threshold. Finally, it further rejects weak corners that are closer than a pre-defined distance to a strong corner. Invariant to affine changes.</p>

<p><em>Maximal Self-Dissimilarity.</em> </p>
<p>The algorithm implements a detector based on the assumption that image patches (edges, corners, blobs etc) which are highly dissimilar over a relatively large extent of their surroundings tend to be repeatable and distinctive. It relies on the computation of a patch’s self-similarity over an extended neighborhood and more precisely it  determines whether or not a pixel (keypoint) shows similar patches in its surroundings using Contextual Self-Dissimilarity (CSD). It provided invariance to viewpoint variations and illmination changes.</p>

<p>Based on image gradients, histograms of gradients (HOG) are calculated for pre-defiend image subregions. For each feature point, a square block is defined.  Applying the Sobel operator, gradient orientation and magnitutes are computed. Pixels are assigned to orientation bins and for each cell a vector of nine values is obtained. Mainly used for pedestrian detection and tracking, sensitive to rotation changes.</p>

<h2 id="kaze_1">KAZE</h2>
<p>KAZE descriptor reassures rotation invariance by finding the dominant orientation within a circular region around every detected feature using a variant of the SURF descriptor. KAZE features are invariant to rotation, scale, limited affine and have more distinctiveness at varying scales with the cost of moderate increase in computational time.</p>

<h2 id="latch">LATCH</h2>
<p><em>Learned Arrangements of Three Patch Codes</em></p>
<p>LATCH is a binary descriptor based on learned comparisons of triplets of image patches instead of pairs to improve robustness. Patch triplets are introduced in order to improve robustness</p>

<h2 id="lss">LSS</h2>
<p><em>Local Self-Similarity</em></p>
<p>Local Self-Similarity is based on the texture features of images to densely calculate local self-similarity descriptors on patch-level. Self similarities are calculated locally within image regions centred around certain patches using sum of squared sum metrics (SSD).  Applicable also for registering video sequences and image retrieval applications as well as object detection and classification.</p>

<h2 id="orb_1">ORB</h2>
<p><em>Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF</em></p>
<p>The descriptor part of ORB is developed in a similar fashion to BRIEF, yet it also provides additional invariance to rotation and robustness to noise. A rotation-aware version of BRIEF (rBRIEF) is used and then a learning method is applied to choose a good subset of binary tests, identifiying features that have high variance and are uncorrelated.</p>

<h2 id="vgg">VGG</h2>
<p>An Oxford Visual Geometry Group descriptor trained end to end using "Descriptor Learning Using Convex Optimisation" (DLCO). Indeed, it tackles the problem of learning pooling regions as a convex optimization, i.e. selecting a few regions among a large set of candidate ones. Dimensionality reduction and discrimination of the the descriptor are also solved by learning. Comparable with other state of the art real value and binary descriptors.</p>

<h2 id="sift_1">SIFT</h2>
<p><em>Scale Invariant Feature Transform</em>
Image gradients are used  to describe the detected keypoints. Magnitudes and orientations are calculated for 16 subregions around the keypoint on a specific scale and for eight orientations and stored in a 128 element non-binary vector. By normalizing the values,  invariance under certain illumination changes is reassured.</p>

<h2 id="surf_1">SURF</h2>
<p><em>Speeded-Up Robust Features</em></p>
<p>SURF describes the detected features using Haar wavelets. Responses are calculated for 16 suregions around the detected feature, which are further subdivided, yielding a 64 element descriptor vector for each detected feature. In a similar fashion with SIFT, illumination invariance is achieved. SURF outperforms SIFT in terms of computational complexity.</p>
